"""GATE 2 — estimate the insulin ACTION peak from observed glucose (2026-08-04).

Gate 1 established that the peak is identifiable from this user's real dose spacing, by recovering
a curve that was known by construction. This estimates the peak from what glucose actually did,
which is the physiological quantity.

MODEL. In a window where insulin is the only thing moving glucose:

    dBG_i  =  -k * conv(dose, activity(.; peak, DIA))_i  +  c  +  e_i

`k` absorbs ISF and any unit scaling; `c` absorbs endogenous production and drift. Both are fitted
PER WINDOW and profiled out analytically (an OLS of dBG on the convolved-activity regressor with an
intercept), so only `peak` is estimated globally. This matters:

  * ISF LEVEL differences between nights — dynamic ISF, site, hormones — cannot bias the peak,
    because each window gets its own amplitude.
  * A change of insulin CONCENTRATION is a pure amplitude change, so it lands entirely in `k` and
    leaves the shape estimate alone. That is what makes a before/after peak comparison meaningful
    across a dilution or a change of strength.

DIA is HELD FIXED, not fitted. Gate 1 showed it carries essentially no signal at these dose sizes
(holding it at the configured value left RMSE unchanged at 0.1917 vs 0.1916), and fitting it drags
the peak with it.

WINDOW SELECTION is the whole ballgame — the estimate is only as good as the isolation:
  COB == 0 throughout, and no carbs recorded in the window or the 3 h before it
  overnight, when unannounced eating is least likely
  steps below a threshold throughout (exercise moves glucose and changes absorption)
  not inside a post-rescue window (rescue carbs are unannounced by definition)
  no CGM gap longer than 15 min, and BG in a plausible range
  at least some insulin delivered, or there is no input to identify anything from

DRIFT IS MODELLED AS A RAMP, NOT A CONSTANT, and this is not cosmetic. Overnight windows sit
across dawn, and an unmodelled rising trend late in a window looks exactly like insulin action
ending early. With only an intercept the pooled estimate is 30.9 min [20.4, 36.9]; adding the
per-window time trend moves it to 35.3 [29.2, 44.2]. The first number invited the conclusion that
the configured peak was too late; it was an artefact of the drift model. A pre-dawn-only cut
(00:00-04:00) independently gives 34.8, agreeing with the trend-controlled figure.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO. Sensor lag (~4 min interstitial plus filter delay) biases every estimate LATE
by roughly a constant. That offset is not removed here: it very nearly cancels in a before/after
comparison, which is how this is meant to be used, but an ABSOLUTE peak from this script should be
read as "action peak as seen through the sensor", a few minutes later than the true one.

Usage:
  python3 gate2_peak_from_glucose.py --user <id>                     # whole history, per-window
  python3 gate2_peak_from_glucose.py --user <id> --before YYYY-MM-DD # pre-change baseline only
